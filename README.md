# Predictive Analysis and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Using Machine Learning

**Abstract:**

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global health concern, with many cases being potentially avoidable through early detection and intervention. This report outlines a project focused on using machine learning to analyze data from thousands of participants to predict and prevent CVD. The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collecting a comprehensive dataset from diverse sources to ensure a robust analysis.
2. **Data Filtering and Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is accurate and reliable by removing inconsistencies and addressing missing values.
3. **Data Transformation**: Converting the data into a format suitable for analysis, including feature engineering and normalization.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and insights within the data to understand the relationships between symptoms and CVD.
5. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets to build and validate predictive models effectively.

The project aims to develop predictive models that can identify individuals at risk of CVD and provide preventive strategies for those already diagnosed. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to enhance early detection, promote healthier lifestyle choices, and improve overall patient outcomes.
